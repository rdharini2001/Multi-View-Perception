# Leveraging Monocular Infrastructure Cameras for Collaborative Multi-View Perception for Indoor Autonomous Mobile Robots 
This repo contains code, data and step-by-step instructions to replicate the paper. This work can be divided into 5 phases - marker-less robot pose estimation, pose uncertainty estimation, camera placement optimziation, data association for multi-camera multi-robot navigation and finally sensor fusion.
